# StaffChat

Allow your staff to speak to other staff.

## Normal Installation (Non-Developer)

You can download the latest version of the plugin from our [resource page on spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/staffchat.42821/) or from [the releases tab on github](https://github.com/RyanMoodGAMING/StaffChat/releases).

## Developer Controbrution

I request that developers contact via a ticket in my [discord](https://discord.gg/T2qKspyxGR) before submitting a Pull Request with any changes. This is for the following reasons:
 1. I know what has been added and you can go into detail on what the feature does.
 2. I know that it is coming from a trustworthy person.
 3. I can add you to the controbution list via your [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/) or [Mc-Market](https://mc-market.org/) name.
